# Target Tester
This is the repository for an Android app that is part of a school project   
in this project we test different technologies for "scanning" targets and   
we will look which is the best in multiple categories.   
The app exists out of a menu where the user can choose for 1 of the 3   
technologies(QR scanner, NFC and GPS) and then the user is directed to  
the screen where that technology can be used for testing.
